converted sym wrapper to a IR, removed @test from the algorithm and checked working for a simple example, note currently the project support for complex examples is very thin and needs to be updated based on new algo intuitions, I have provided few approaches and implemented them but those update the genATC algorithm hence its better to wait for sir for ideal updates, rest it is working properly for normal base cases, not we haven't implemented cases with function return value having links (the jml annotation is \return) yet that should be implemented too
